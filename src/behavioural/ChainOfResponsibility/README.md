# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The **Chain of Responsibility** is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers. Each handler in the chain processes the request or forwards it to the next handler until it's handled or the end of the chain is reached.

## Key Components

1. Handler Interface:

2. Concrete Handlers:
    Implement the handler interface. Process the request if they can; otherwise, pass it to the next handler.
3. Client:
    Creates the chain and sends the request to the first handler.
