# **Abstract Factory Pattern**

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows a system to use multiple object families interchangeably by working with abstract types rather than concrete implementations.

## **Purpose**

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It helps achieve flexibility and consistency in object creation.

## **When to Use**

1. When your application needs to create families of related objects that work together.
2. When you want to decouple the client code from the actual object creation process.
3. When you need to switch object families dynamically (e.g., themes, APIs).
4. When ensuring consistency among related objects is critical.

## **Components**

1. **Abstract Factory**: Defines an interface for creating abstract product families.
2. **Concrete Factory**: Implements the abstract factory interface and provides specific products.
3. **Abstract Product**: Defines the interface for a type of product.
4. **Concrete Product**: Implements the abstract product interface.
5. **Client**: Uses the factory to interact with products without knowing their implementations.

## **Basic Pseudo Code for Abstract Factory Pattern**

```pseudo
// Abstract Product Interface
interface ProductA {
    methodA()
}

interface ProductB {
    methodB()
}

// Concrete Products
class ProductA1 implements ProductA {
    methodA() { // Implementation for Product A1 }
}

class ProductA2 implements ProductA {
    methodA() { // Implementation for Product A2 }
}

class ProductB1 implements ProductB {
    methodB() { // Implementation for Product B1 }
}

class ProductB2 implements ProductB {
    methodB() { // Implementation for Product B2 }
}

// Abstract Factory Interface
interface AbstractFactory {
    createProductA(): ProductA
    createProductB(): ProductB
}

// Concrete Factories
class ConcreteFactory1 implements AbstractFactory {
    createProductA() { return new ProductA1() }
    createProductB() { return new ProductB1() }
}

class ConcreteFactory2 implements AbstractFactory {
    createProductA() { return new ProductA2() }
    createProductB() { return new ProductB2() }
}

// Client
class Client {
    constructor(factory: AbstractFactory) {
        this.productA = factory.createProductA()
        this.productB = factory.createProductB()
    }
}
```

## Real-World Examples:

1. UI Themes:

- Factories produce families of UI components (buttons, textboxes, dropdowns) specific to a theme (e.g., DarkTheme, LightTheme).

2. Operating Systems:

- Factories create system-specific components, such as WindowsFactory or MacOSFactory, for dialogs, menus, or file systems.

3. Car Manufacturing:

- Factories for different car brands producing components like engines, tires, and bodies for their specific models.

4. Database Drivers:

- Factories that produce connections, commands, and transactions for databases like MySQL, SQL Server, or PostgreSQL.

5. Cross-Platform Games:

- Factories produce game elements (UI, sprites, sounds) for platforms like PC, console, or mobile.

## Benefits/Advantages

1. Encapsulation of Object Creation: Clients only interact with abstract interfaces.
2. Flexibility: Easy to switch between different object families dynamically.
3. Consistency: Ensures that related objects always work together.
4. Extensibility: Adding new object families is straightforward by implementing new factories.

## Drawbacks/Disadvantages

1. Complexity: Introduces additional classes and interfaces, increasing complexity.
2. Rigid Structure: Adding new products to an existing family may require modifying all factories.
3. Overhead: Not suitable for simple applications or scenarios where object families are static.
